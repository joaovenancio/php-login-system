# Login System
VERSION 1.0

## PROJECT GOALS:
- Create a Login system that redirects to a fictitious page using the MySQL database.

- The system:

  - Establishes a connection with a fictitious MySQL database;

  - Check if the data provided by the user (username and password) is present in the database;

  - If the data is present, start the session and redirect to the user's fictitious page;

  - If the data is not present, display an error message.

## HOW TO RUN:
- Edit the information in the file processamentoBanco.php ($servername, $username, and $password) to input your Database information, and X in pagDoUsuario.php (<th> X </th>; echo "<td>".$student['X']."</td>";) to print a value from your database of the logged-in user;

- Start the website with login.php.
